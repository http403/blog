As my instructor said, technical documentation need to get straight on point, any other else are considered lard. But, if you like lard, I still have the old version up.\nI will show how to serve Samba share over Tailscale in a secure and (some what) hidden manner. I don\u0026rsquo;t imply that SMB over Internet is not secure, but I\u0026rsquo;m more confident with Tailscale, or actually Wireguard that running under the hood.\nThe usual way As a person that have some experience with Linux server and setting up Internet facing applications, it\u0026rsquo;s normal to assume I only need to force Samba to listen only the Wireguard interface. So specify interface to tailnet0, and enable bind interface only in the global section of samba.conf. However, that\u0026rsquo;s the trap. Wireguard interface is Point-to-Point, which Samba bind interface only won\u0026rsquo;t cope with.\nSolution The replacement option is host allow in the share configuration. By limiting the IP ranges to CGNAT (100.64.0.0/10), which Tailscale uses, only clients on Tailscale will able to connect. Still, the share is viewable from the public. To hide it, use make it into a hidden share by appending a dollar sign ($) after the share name. For example, a share call secret becomes secret$. This is not perfect, but acceptable.\nDemo config [share$] path = /home/user/share read only = no valid user = user hosts allow = 100.64.0.0/10 ","permalink":"https://hartmantam.xyz/tech/samba-over-tailscale-wireguard/","summary":"Edit: I rewritten my old article as that was too long and too many irrelevant things.
