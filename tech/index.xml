As my instructor said, technical documentation need to get straight on point, any other else are considered lard. But, if you like lard, I still have the old version up.
I will show how to serve Samba share over Tailscale in a secure and (some what) hidden manner. I don&amp;rsquo;t imply that SMB over Internet is not secure, but I&amp;rsquo;m more confident with Tailscale, or actually Wireguard that running under the hood.</description></item><item><title>Hello World</title><link>https://hartmantam.xyz/tech/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Aug 2022 12:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://hartmantam.xyz/tech/hello-world/</guid><description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know why, but I want to have a blog long ago. I always have a vague idea of documenting little things that I learnt but never took action, or failed to complete the post and give up mid-way.
TBH, I don&amp;rsquo;t know what will be posted here but by starting with this post I believe it is a good direction I&amp;rsquo;m heading.
Still, I don&amp;rsquo;t know when and what I will post.</description></item></channel></rss>
