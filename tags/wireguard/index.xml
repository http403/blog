As my instructor said, technical documentation need to get straight on point, any other else are considered lard. But, if you like lard, I still have the old version up.
I will show how to serve Samba share over Tailscale in a secure and (some what) hidden manner. I don&amp;rsquo;t imply that SMB over Internet is not secure, but I&amp;rsquo;m more confident with Tailscale, or actually Wireguard that running under the hood.</description></item><item><title>Samba over Tailscale/Wireguard [Old]</title><link>https://hartmantam.xyz/hidden/samba-over-tailscale-wireguard-old/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jan 2023 18:14:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hartmantam.xyz/hidden/samba-over-tailscale-wireguard-old/</guid><description>I recently found out about Tailscale, a control plane for WireGuard. I decided to revisit an old project of mine and use it to set up a Samba server on an long ignored dedicated server so that I could access my videos remotely. However, the process proved to be more challenging than I had anticipated.
Goal The goal was to access my videos from the server via my Windows PC and Android phone, while also ensuring that the data was secure in transit, and not accessed by others.</description></item></channel></rss>
